        <p>Welcome to the <b>Forge</b> - where raw ideas were hammered, bent and sharpened into designs over the years. A collection of experiments, sparks and solid builds that shaped my craft. Although showcasing every design I have made over the years is beyond the scope of the website (and a little pointless if you ask me!), I hope you will like the 'cherry-picked' ones shown below.</p>
    <p>CAD (and 3D in general) is fascinating. And I hope you will have as much fun perusing through some of my work as I had designing them. I have segregated the designs in 3 parts, 'something for every audience' kind of a deal I suppose.</p>
        <p>Consider this page as my personal 'Instagram' for design (if you must), except this page will still be online if an outage takes Meta's server for some reason.</p>
